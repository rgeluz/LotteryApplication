 * Assignment: 
 * Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an array of
 * five integers named lottery and should generate a random number in the
 * range of 0 through 9 for each element in the array. The user should enter five
 * digits, which should be stored in an integer array named user. The program is to
 * compare the corresponding elements in the two arrays and keep a count of the
 * digits that match. For example, the following shows the lottery array and the user
 * array with sample numbers stored in each. There are two matching digits
 * (elements 2 and 4).
 * 
 * lottery array:
 * ____________
 * 7 4 9 1 3
 * ____________
 * 
 * user array:
 * ___________
 * 4 2 9 7 3
 * ___________
 * 
 * The program should display the random numbers stored in the lottery array and
 * the number of matching digits. If all of the digits match, display a message
 * proclaiming the user as a grand prize winner.
